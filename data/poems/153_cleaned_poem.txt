I tried to win the nomination
For president of the County-board
And I made speeches all over the County
Denouncing Solomon Purple, my rival,
As an enemy of the people,
In league with the master-foes of man.
Young idealists, broken warriors,
Hobbling on one crutch of hope,
Souls that stake their all on the truth,
Losers of worlds at heavens bidding,
Flocked about me and followed my voice
As the savior of the County.
But Solomon won the nomination;
And then I faced about,
And rallied my followers to his standard,
And made him victor, made him King
Of the Golden Mountain with the door
Which closed on my heels just as I entered,
Flattered by Solomons invitation,
To be the County-boards secretary.
And out in the cold stood all my followers:
Young idealists, broken warriors
Hobbling on one crutch of hope
Souls that staked their all on the truth,
Losers of worlds at heavens bidding,
Watching the Devil kick the Millennium
Over the Golden Mountain.
