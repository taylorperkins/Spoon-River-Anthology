HE protested all his life long 
The newspapers lied about him villainously; 
That he was not at fault for Minervas fall, 
But only tried to help her. 
Poor soul so sunk in sin he could not see         5
That even trying to help her, as he called it, 
He had broken the law human and divine. 
Passers by, an ancient admonition to you: 
If your ways would be ways of pleasantness, 
And all your pathways peace,  10
Love God and keep his commandments.
