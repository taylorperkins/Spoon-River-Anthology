NOTHING in life is alien to you:
I was a penniless girl from Summum
Who stepped from the morning train in Spoon River.
All the houses stood before me with closed doors
And drawn shadesI was barred out;
I had no place or part in any of them.
And I walked past the old McNeely mansion,
A castle of stone mid walks and gardens,
With workmen about the place on guard,
And the County and State upholding it
For its lordly owner, full of pride.
I was so hungry I had a vision:
I saw a giant pair of scissors
Dip from the sky, like the beam of a dredge,
And cut the house in two like a curtain.
But at the Commercial I saw a man,
Who winked at me as I asked for work
It was Wash McNeelys son.
He proved the link in the chain of title
To half my ownership of the mansion,
Through a breach of promise suitthe scissors.
So, you see, the house, from the day I was born,
Was only waiting for me.
