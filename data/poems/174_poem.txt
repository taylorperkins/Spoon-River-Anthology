I wanted to be County Judge 
One more term, so as to round out a service 
Of thirty years. 
But my friends left me and joined my enemies, 
And they elected a new man.         5
Then a spirit of revenge seized me, 
And I infected my four sons with it, 
And I brooded upon retaliation, 
Until the great physician, Nature, 
Smote me through with paralysis  10
To give my soul and body a rest. 
Did my sons get power and money? 
Did they serve the people or yoke them, 
To till and harvest fields of self? 
For how could they ever forget  15
My face at my bed-room window, 
Sitting helpless amid my golden cages 
Of singing canaries, 
Looking at the old court-house?
