MY lifes blossom might have bloomed on all sides 
Save for a bitter wind which stunted my petals 
On the side of me which you in the village could see. 
From the dust I lift a voice of protest: 
My flowering side you never saw!         5
Ye living ones, ye are fools indeed 
Who do not know the ways of the wind 
And the unseen forces 
That govern the processes of life.
