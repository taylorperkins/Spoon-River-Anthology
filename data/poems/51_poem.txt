HERE lies the body of Lois Spears, 
Born Lois Fluke, daughter of Willard Fluke, 
Wife of Cyrus Spears, 
Mother of Myrtle and Virgil Spears, 
Children with clear eyes and sound limbs         5
(I was born blind). 
I was the happiest of women 
As wife, mother and housekeeper, 
Caring for my loved ones, 
And making my home  10
A place of order and bounteous hospitality: 
For I went about the rooms, 
And about the garden 
With an instinct as sure as sight, 
As though there were eyes in my finger tips  15
Glory to God in the highest.
