BETTER than granite, Spoon River, 
Is the memory-picture you keep of me 
Standing before the pioneer men and women 
There at Concord Church on Communion day. 
Speaking in broken voice of the peasant youth         5
Of Galilee who went to the city 
And was killed by bankers and lawyers; 
My voice mingling with the June wind 
That blew over wheat fields from Atterbury; 
While the white stones in the burying ground  10
Around the Church shimmered in the summer sun. 
And there, though my own memories 
Were too great to bear, were you, O pioneers, 
With bowed heads breathing forth your sorrow 
For the sons killed in battle and the daughters  15
And little children who vanished in lifes morning, 
Or at the intolerable hour of noon. 
But in those moments of tragic silence, 
When the wine and bread were passed, 
Came the reconciliation for us  20
Us the ploughmen and the hewers of wood, 
Us the peasants, brothers of the peasant of Galilee 
To us came the Comforter 
And the consolation of tongues of flame!
