WHAT do you see now? 
Globes of red, yellow, purple. 
Just a moment! And now? 
My father and mother and sisters. 
Yes! And now?         5
Knights at arms, beautiful women, kind faces. 
Try this. 
A field of graina city. 
Very good! And now? 
A young woman with angels bending over her.  10
A heavier lens! And now? 
Many women with bright eyes and open lips. 
Try this. 
Just a goblet on a table. 
Oh I see! Try this lens!  15
Just an open spaceI see nothing in particular. 
Well, now! 
Pine trees, a lake, a summer sky. 
Thats better. And now? 
A book.  20
Read a page for me. 
I cant. My eyes are carried beyond the page. 
Try this lens. 
Depths of air. 
Excellent! And now?  25
Light, just light, making everything below it a toy world. 
Very well, well make the glasses accordingly.
