YOU praise my self-sacrifice, Spoon River, 
In rearing Irene and Mary, 
Orphans of my older sister! 
And you censure Irene and Mary 
For their contempt for me!         5
But praise not my self-sacrifice, 
And censure not their contempt; 
I reared them, I cared for them, true enough! 
But I poisoned my benefactions 
With constant reminders of their dependence.  10
