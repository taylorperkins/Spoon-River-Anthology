MY name used to be in the papers daily 
As having dined somewhere, 
Or traveled somewhere, 
Or rented a house in Paris, 
Where I entertained the nobility.         5
I was forever eating or traveling, 
Or taking the cure at Baden-Baden. 
Now I am here to do honor 
To Spoon River, here beside the family whence I sprang. 
No one cares now where I dined,  10
Or lived, or whom I entertained, 
Or how often I took the cure at Baden-Baden!
