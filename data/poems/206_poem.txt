I WROTE him a letter asking him for old times sake 
To discharge my sick boy from the army; 
But maybe he couldnt read it. 
Then I went to town and had James Garber, 
Who wrote beautifully, write him a letter;         5
But maybe that was lost in the mails. 
So I traveled all the way to Washington. 
I was more than an hour finding the White House. 
And when I found it they turned me away, 
Hiding their smiles. Then I thought:  10
Oh, well, he aint the same as when I boarded him 
And he and my husband worked together 
And all of us called him Abe, there in Menard. 
As a last attempt I turned to a guard and said: 
Please say its old Aunt Hannah Armstrong  15
From Illinois, come to see him about her sick boy 
In the army. 
Well, just in a moment they let me in! 
And when he saw me he broke in a laugh, 
And dropped his business as president,  20
And wrote in his own hand Dougs discharge, 
Talking the while of the early days, 
And telling stories.
