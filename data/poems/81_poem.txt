IF I could have lived another year 
I could have finished my flying machine, 
And become rich and famous. 
Hence it is fitting the workman 
Who tried to chisel a dove for me         5
Made it look more like a chicken. 
For what is it all but being hatched, 
And running about the yard, 
To the day of the block? 
Save that a man has an angels brain,  10
And sees the ax from the first!
