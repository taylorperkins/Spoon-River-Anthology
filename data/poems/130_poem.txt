EVERYONE laughed at Col. Prichard 
For buying an engine so powerful 
That it wrecked itself, and wrecked the grinder 
He ran it with. 
But here is a joke of cosmic size:         5
The urge of nature that made a man 
Evolve from his brain a spiritual life 
Oh miracle of the world! 
The very same brain with which the ape and wolf 
Get food and shelter and procreate themselves.  10
Nature has made man do this, 
In a world where she gives him nothing to do 
After all(though the strength of his soul goes round 
In a futile waste of power, 
To gear itself to the mills of the gods)  15
But get food and shelter and procreate himself!
