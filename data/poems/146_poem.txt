MY parents thought that I would be 
As great as Edison or greater: 
For as a boy I made balloons 
And wondrous kites and toys with clocks 
And little engines with tracks to run on         5
And telephones of cans and thread. 
I played the cornet and painted pictures, 
Modeled in clay and took the part 
Of the villain in the Octoroon. 
But then at twenty-one I married  10
And had to live, and so, to live 
I learned the trade of making watches 
And kept the jewelry store on the square, 
Thinking, thinking, thinking, thinking, 
Not of business, but of the engine  15
I studied the calculus to build. 
And all Spoon River watched and waited 
To see it work, but it never worked. 
And a few kind souls believed my genius 
Was somehow hampered by the store.  20
It wasnt true. The truth was this: 
I didnt have the brains.
