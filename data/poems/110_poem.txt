I WAS the only child of Frances Harris of Virginia 
And Thomas Greene of Kentucky, 
Of valiant and honorable blood both. 
To them I owe all that I became, 
Judge, member of Congress, leader in the State.         5
From my mother I inherited 
Vivacity, fancy, language; 
From my father will, judgment, logic. 
All honor to them 
For what service I was to the people!  10
