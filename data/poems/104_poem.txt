VERY well, you liberals, 
And navigators into realms intellectual, 
You sailors through heights imaginative, 
Blown about by erratic currents, tumbling into air pockets, 
You Margaret Fuller Slacks, Petits,         5
And Tennessee Claflin Shopes 
You found with all your boasted wisdom 
How hard at the last it is 
To keep the soul from splitting into cellular atoms. 
While we, seekers of earths treasures,  10
Getters and hoarders of gold, 
Are self-contained, compact, harmonized, 
Even to the end.
