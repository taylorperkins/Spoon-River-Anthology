IN the last spring I ever knew, 
In those last days, 
I sat in the forsaken orchard 
Where beyond fields of greenery shimmered 
The hills at Millers Ford;         5
Just to muse on the apple tree 
With its ruined trunk and blasted branches, 
And shoots of green whose delicate blossoms 
Were sprinkled over the skeleton tangle, 
Never to grow in fruit.  10
And there was I with my spirit girded 
By the flesh half dead, the senses numb, 
Yet thinking of youth and the earth in youth, 
Such phantom blossoms palely shining 
Over the lifeless boughs of Time.  15
O earth that leaves us ere heaven takes us! 
Had I been only a tree to shiver 
With dreams of spring and a leafy youth, 
Then I had fallen in the cyclone 
Which swept me out of the souls suspense  20
Where its neither earth nor heaven.
