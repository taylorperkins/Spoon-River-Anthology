I was a lawyer like Harmon Whitney 
Or Kinsey Keene or Garrison Standard, 
For I tried the rights of property, 
Although by lamp-light, for thirty years, 
In that poker room in the opera house.         5
And I say to you that Lifes a gambler 
Head and shoulders above us all. 
No mayor alive can close the house. 
And if you lose, you can squeal as you will; 
Youll not get back your money.  10
He makes the percentage hard to conquer; 
He stacks the cards to catch your weakness 
And not to meet your strength. 
And he gives you seventy years to play: 
For if you cannot win in seventy  15
You cannot win at all. 
So, if you lose, get out of the room 
Get out of the room when your time is up. 
Its mean to sit and fumble the cards, 
And curse your losses, leaden-eyed,  20
Whining to try and try.
