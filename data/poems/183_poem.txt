What but the love of God could have softened 
And made forgiving the people of Spoon River 
Toward me who wronged the bed of Thomas Merritt 
And murdered him beside? 
Oh, loving hearts that took me in again         5
When I returned from fourteen years in prison! 
Oh, helping hands that in the church received me, 
And heard with tears my penitent confession, 
Who took the sacrament of bread and wine! 
Repent, ye living ones, and rest with Jesus.  10
