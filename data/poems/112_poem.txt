OH many times did Ernest Hyde and I 
Argue about the freedom of the will. 
My favorite metaphor was Pricketts cow 
Roped out to grass, and free you know as far 
As the length of the rope.         5
One day while arguing so, watching the cow 
Pull at the rope to get beyond the circle 
Which she had eaten bare, 
Out came the stake, and tossing up her head, 
She ran for us.  10
Whats that, free-will or what? said Ernest, running. 
I fell just as she gored me to my death.
