GOD! ask me not to record your wonders, 
I admit the stars and the suns 
And the countless worlds. 
But I have measured their distances 
And weighed them and discovered their substances.         5
I have devised wings for the air, 
And keels for water, 
And horses of iron for the earth. 
I have lengthened the vision you gave me a million times, 
And the hearing you gave me a million times,  10
I have leaped over space with speech, 
And taken fire for light out of the air. 
I have built great cities and bored through the hills, 
And bridged majestic waters. 
I have written the Iliad and Hamlet;  15
And I have explored your mysteries, 
And searched for you without ceasing, 
And found you again after losing you 
In hours of weariness 
And I ask you:  20
How would you like to create a sun 
And the next day have the worms 
Slipping in and out between your fingers?
