THEY have chiseled on my stone the words:
His life was gentle, and the elements so mixed in him
That nature might stand up and say to all the world,
This was a man.
Those who knew me smile
As they read this empty rhetoric.
My epitaph should have been:
Life was not gentle to him,
And the elements so mixed in him
That he made warfare on life,
In the which he was slain.
While I lived I could not cope with slanderous tongues,
Now that I am dead I must submit to an epitaph
Graven by a fool!
