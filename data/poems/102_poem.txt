When I went to the city, Mary McNeely, 
I meant to return for you, yes I did. 
But Laura, my landladys daughter, 
Stole into my life somehow, and won me away. 
Then after some years whom should I meet         5
But Georgine Miner from Nilesa sprout 
Of the free love, Fourierist gardens that flourished 
Before the war all over Ohio. 
Her dilettante lover had tired of her, 
And she turned to me for strength and solace.  10
She was some kind of a crying thing 
One takes in ones arms, and all at once 
It slimes your face with its running nose, 
And voids its essence all over you; 
Then bites your hand and springs away.  15
And there you stand bleeding and smelling to heaven! 
Why, Mary McNeely, I was not worthy 
To kiss the hem of your robe!
