THE COOPER should know about tubs. 
But I learned about life as well, 
And you who loiter around these graves 
Think you know life. 
You think your eye sweeps about a wide horizon, perhaps,         5
In truth you are only looking around the interior of your tub. 
You cannot lift yourself to its rim 
And see the outer world of things, 
And at the same time see yourself. 
You are submerged in the tub of yourself  10
Taboos and rules and appearances, 
Are the staves of your tub. 
Break them and dispel the witchcraft 
Of thinking your tub is life! 
And that you know life!  15
