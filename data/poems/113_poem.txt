NOT character, not fortitude, not patience 
Were mine, the which the village thought I had 
In bearing with my wife, while preaching on, 
Doing the work God chose for me. 
I loathed her as a termagant, as a wanton.         5
I knew of her adulteries, every one. 
But even so, if I divorced the woman 
I must forsake the ministry. 
Therefore to do Gods work and have it crop, 
I bore with her!  10
So lied I to myself! 
So lied I to Spoon River! 
Yet I tried lecturing, ran for the legislature, 
Canvassed for books, with just the thought in mind: 
If I make money thus, I will divorce her.  15
