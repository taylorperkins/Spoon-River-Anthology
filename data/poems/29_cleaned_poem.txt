Do the boys and girls still go to Sievers
For cider, after school, in late September?
Or gather hazel nuts among the thickets
On Aaron Hatfields farm when the frosts begin?
For many times with the laughing girls and boys
Played I along the road and over the hills
When the sun was low and the air was cool,
Stopping to club the walnut tree
Standing leafless against a flaming west.
Now, the smell of the autumn smoke,
And the dropping acorns,
And the echoes about the vales
Bring dreams of life. They hover over me.
They question me:
Where are those laughing comrades?
How many are with me, how many
In the old orchards along the way to Sievers,
And in the woods that overlook
The quiet water?
