THERE would be a knock at the door 
And I would arise at midnight and go to the shop, 
Where belated travelers would hear me hammering 
Sepulchral boards and tacking satin. 
And often I wondered who would go with me         5
To the distant land, our names the theme 
For talk, in the same week, for Ive observed 
Two always go together. 
Chase Henry was paired with Edith Conant; 
And Jonathan Somers with Willie Metcalf;  10
And Editor Hamblin with Francis Turner, 
When he prayed to live longer than Editor Whedon 
And Thomas Rhodes with widow McFarlane; 
And Emily Sparks with Barry Holden; 
And Oscar Hummel with Davis Matlock;  15
And Editor Whedon with Fiddler Jones; 
And Faith Matheny with Dorcas Gustine. 
And I, the solemnest man in town, 
Stepped off with Daisy Fraser.
