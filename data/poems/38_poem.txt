DID you ever find out 
Which one of the OBrien boys it was 
Who snapped the toy pistol against my hand? 
There when the flags were red and white 
In the breeze and Bucky Estil         5
Was firing the cannon brought to Spoon River 
From Vicksburg by Captain Harris; 
And the lemonade stands were running 
And the band was playing, 
To have it all spoiled  10
By a piece of a cap shot under the skin of my hand, 
And the boys all crowding about me saying: 
Youll die of lock-jaw, Charlie, sure. 
Oh, dear! oh, dear! 
What chum of mine could have done it?  15
