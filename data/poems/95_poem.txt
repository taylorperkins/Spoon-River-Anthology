JONAS KEENE thought his lot a hard one 
Because his children were all failures. 
But I know of a fate more trying than that: 
It is to be a failure while your children are successes. 
For I raised a brood of eagles         5
Who flew away at last, leaving me 
A crow on the abandoned bough. 
Then, with the ambition to prefix Honorable to my name, 
And thus to win my childrens admiration, 
I ran for County Superintendent of Schools,  10
Spending my accumulations to winand lost. 
That fall my daughter received first prize in Paris 
For her picture, entitled, The Old Mill 
(It was of the water mill before Henry Wilkin put in steam.) 
The feeling that I was not worthy of her finished me.  15
