Yes, here I lie close to a stunted rose bush 
In a forgotten place near the fence 
Where the thickets from Sievers woods 
Have crept over, growing sparsely. 
And you, you are a leader in New York,         5
The wife of a noted millionaire, 
A name in the society columns, 
Beautiful, admired, magnified perhaps 
By the mirage of distance. 
You have succeeded, I have failed  10
In the eyes of the world. 
You are alive, I am dead. 
Yet I know that I vanquished your spirit; 
And I know that lying here far from you, 
Unheard of among your great friends  15
In the brilliant world where you move, 
I am really the unconquerable power over your life 
That robs it of complete triumph.
