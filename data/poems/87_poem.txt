ALMOST the shell of a woman after the surgeons knife! 
And almost a year to creep back into strength, 
Till the dawn of our wedding decennial 
Found me my seeming self again. 
We walked the forest together,         5
By a path of soundless moss and turf. 
But I could not look in your eyes, 
And you could not look in my eyes, 
For such sorrow was oursthe beginning of gray in your hair, 
And I but a shell of myself.  10
And what did we talk of?sky and water, 
Anything, most, to hide our thoughts. 
And then your gift of wild roses, 
Set on the table to grace our dinner. 
Poor heart, how bravely you struggled  15
To imagine and live a remembered rapture! 
Then my spirit drooped as the night came on, 
And you left me alone in my room for a while, 
As you did when I was a bride, poor heart. 
And I looked in the mirror and something said:  20
One should be all dead when one is half-dead 
Nor ever mock life, nor ever cheat love. 
And I did it looking there in the mirror 
Dear, have you ever understood?
