AT four oclock in late October
I sat alone in the country school-house
Back from the road mid stricken fields,
And an eddy of wind blew leaves on the pane,
And crooned in the flue of the cannon-stove,
With its open door blurring the shadows
With the spectral glow of a dying fire.
In an idle mood I was running the planchette
All at once my wrist grew limp,
And my hand moved rapidly over the board,
Till the name of Charles Guiteau was spelled,
Who threatened to materialize before me.
I rose and fled from the room bare-headed
Into the dusk, afraid of my gift.
And after that the spirits swarmed
Chaucer, Cæsar, Poe and Marlowe,
Cleopatra and Mrs. Surrat
Wherever I went, with messages,
Mere trifling twaddle, Spoon River agreed.
You talk nonsense to children, dont you?
And suppose I see what you never saw
And never heard of and have no word for,
I must talk nonsense when you ask me
What it is I see!
