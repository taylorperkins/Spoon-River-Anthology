OUT of a cell into this darkened space 
The end at twenty-five! 
My tongue could not speak what stirred within me, 
And the village thought me a fool. 
Yet at the start there was a clear vision,         5
A high and urgent purpose in my soul 
Which drove me on trying to memorize 
The Encyclopedia Britannica!
