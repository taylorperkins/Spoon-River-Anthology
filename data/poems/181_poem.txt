At first I suspected something 
She acted so calm and absent-minded. 
And one day I heard the back door shut, 
As I entered the front, and I saw him slink 
Back of the smokehouse into the lot,         5
And run across the field. 
And I meant to kill him on sight. 
But that day, walking near Fourth Bridge, 
Without a stick or a stone at hand, 
All of a sudden I saw him standing,  10
Scared to death, holding his rabbits, 
And all I could say was, Dont, Dont, Dont, 
As he aimed and fired at my heart.
