All your sorrow, Louise, and hatred of me
Sprang from your delusion that it was wantonness
Of spirit and contempt of your souls rights
Which made me turn to Annabelle and forsake you.
You really grew to hate me for love of me,
Because I was your souls happiness,
Formed and tempered
To solve your life for you, and would not.
But you were my misery. If you had been
My happiness would I not have clung to you?
This is lifes sorrow:
That one can be happy only where two are;
And that our hearts are drawn to stars
Which want us not.
