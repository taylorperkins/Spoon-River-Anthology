THE PINE woods on the hill, 
And the farmhouse miles away, 
Showed clear as though behind a lens 
Under a sky of peacock blue! 
But a blanket of cloud by afternoon         5
Muffled the earth. And you walked the road 
And the clover field, where the only sound 
Was the crickets liquid tremolo. 
Then the sun went down between great drifts 
Of distant storms. For a rising wind  10
Swept clean the sky and blew the flames 
Of the unprotected stars 
And swayed the russet moon, 
Hanging between the rim of the hill 
And the twinkling boughs of the apple orchard.  15
You walked the shore in thought 
Where the throats of the waves were like whip-poor-wills 
Singing beneath the water and crying 
To the wash of the wind in the cedar trees, 
Till you stood, too full for tears, by the cot,  20
And looking up saw Jupiter, 
Tipping the spire of the giant pine, 
And looking down saw my vacant chair, 
Rocked by the wind on the lonely porch 
Be brave, Beloved!  25
