Were you not ashamed, fellow citizens,
When my estate was probated and everyone knew
How small a fortune I left?
You who hounded me in life,
To give, give, give to the churches, to the poor,
To the village!me who had already given much.
And think you not I did not know
That the pipe-organ, which I gave to the church,
Played its christening songs when Deacon Rhodes,
Who broke the bank and all but ruined me,
Worshipped for the first time after his acquittal?
