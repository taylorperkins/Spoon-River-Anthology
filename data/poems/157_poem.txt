MY mother was for womans rights 
And my father was the rich miller at London Mills. 
I dreamed of the wrongs of the world and wanted to right them. 
When my father died, I set out to see peoples and countries 
In order to learn how to reform the world.         5
I traveled through many lands. 
I saw the ruins of Rome, 
And the ruins of Athens, 
And the ruins of Thebes. 
And I sat by moonlight amid the necropolis of Memphis.  10
There I was caught up by wings of flame, 
And a voice from heaven said to me: 
Injustice, Untruth destroyed them. Go forth! 
Preach Justice! Preach Truth! 
And I hastened back to Spoon River  15
To say farewell to my mother before beginning my work. 
They all saw a strange light in my eye. 
And by and by, when I talked, they discovered 
What had come in my mind. 
Then Jonathan Swift Somers challenged me to debate  20
The subject, (I taking the negative): 
Pontius Pilate, the Greatest Philosopher of the World. 
And he won the debate by saying at last, 
Before you reform the world, Mr. Tutt, 
Please answer the question of Pontius Pilate:  25
What is Truth?
