ALL they said was true:
I wrecked my fathers bank with my loans
To dabble in wheat; but this was true
I was buying wheat for him as well,
Who couldnt margin the deal in his name
Because of his church relationship.
And while George Reece was serving his term
I chased the will-o-the-wisp of women,
And the mockery of wine in New York.
Its deathly to sicken of wine and women
When nothing else is left in life.
But suppose your head is gray, and bowed
On a table covered with acrid stubs
Of cigarettes and empty glasses,
And a knock is heard, and you know its the knock
So long drowned out by popping corks
And the pea-cock screams of demireps
And you look up, and theres your Theft,
Who waited until your head was gray,
And your heart skipped beats to say to you:
The game is ended. Ive called for you,
Go out on Broadway and be run over,
Theyll ship you back to Spoon River.
