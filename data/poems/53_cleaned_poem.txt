My wife lost her health,
And dwindled until she weighed scarce ninety pounds.
Then that woman, whom the men
Styled Cleopatra, came along.
And wewe married ones
All broke our vows, myself among the rest.
Years passed and one by one
Death claimed them all in some hideous form,
And I was borne along by dreams
Of Gods particular grace for me,
And I began to write, write, write, reams on reams
Of the second coming of Christ.
Then Christ came to me and said,
Go into the church and stand before the congregation
And confess your sin.
But just as I stood up and began to speak
I saw my little girl, who was sitting in the front seat
My little girl who was born blind!
After that, all is blackness!
