Henry got me with child,
Knowing that I could not bring forth life
Without losing my own.
In my youth therefore I entered the portals of dust.
Traveler, it is believed in the village where I lived
That Henry loved me with a husbandÂ’s love,
But I proclaim from the dust
That he slew me to gratify his hatred.
