OVER and over they used to ask me, 
While buying the wine or the beer, 
In Peoria first, and later in Chicago, 
Denver, Frisco, New York, wherever I lived, 
How I happened to lead the life,         5
And what was the start of it. 
Well, I told them a silk dress, 
And a promise of marriage from a rich man 
(It was Lucius Atherton). 
But that was not really it at all.  10
Suppose a boy steals an apple 
From the tray at the grocery store, 
And they all begin to call him a thief, 
The editor, minister, judge, and all the people 
A thief, a thief, a thief, wherever he goes.  15
And he cant get work, and he cant get bread 
Without stealing it, why the boy will steal. 
Its the way the people regard the theft of the apple 
That makes the boy what he is.
