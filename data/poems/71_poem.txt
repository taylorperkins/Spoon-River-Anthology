I WAS the milliner 
Talked about, lied about, 
Mother of Dora, 
Whose strange disappearance 
Was charged to her rearing.         5
My eye quick to beauty 
Saw much beside ribbons 
And buckles and feathers 
And leghorns and felts, 
To set off sweet faces,  10
And dark hair and gold. 
One thing I will tell you 
And one I will ask: 
The stealers of husbands 
Wear powder and trinkets,  15
And fashionable hats. 
Wives, wear them yourselves. 
Hats may make divorces 
They also prevent them. 
Well now, let me ask you:  20
If all of the children, born here in Spoon River 
Had been reared by the County, somewhere on a farm; 
And the fathers and mothers had been given their freedom 
To live and enjoy, change mates if they wished, 
Do you think that Spoon River  25
Had been any the worse?
