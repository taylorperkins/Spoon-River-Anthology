After I had attended lectures 
At our Chautauqua, and studied French 
For twenty years, committing the grammar 
Almost by heart, 
I thought Id take a trip to Paris         5
To give my culture a final polish. 
So I went to Peoria for a passport 
(Thomas Rhodes was on the train that morning.) 
And there the clerk of the district Court 
Made me swear to support and defend  10
The constitutionyes, even me 
Who couldnt defend or support it at all! 
And what do you think? That very morning 
The Federal Judge, in the very next room 
To the room where I took the oath,  15
Decided the constitution 
Exempted Rhodes from paying taxes 
For the water works of Spoon River!
