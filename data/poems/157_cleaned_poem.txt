My mother was for womans rights
And my father was the rich miller at London Mills.
I dreamed of the wrongs of the world and wanted to right them.
When my father died, I set out to see peoples and countries
In order to learn how to reform the world.
I traveled through many lands.
I saw the ruins of Rome,
And the ruins of Athens,
And the ruins of Thebes.
And I sat by moonlight amid the necropolis of Memphis.
There I was caught up by wings of flame,
And a voice from heaven said to me:
Injustice, Untruth destroyed them. Go forth!
Preach Justice! Preach Truth!
And I hastened back to Spoon River
To say farewell to my mother before beginning my work.
They all saw a strange light in my eye.
And by and by, when I talked, they discovered
What had come in my mind.
Then Jonathan Swift Somers challenged me to debate
The subject, (I taking the negative):
Pontius Pilate, the Greatest Philosopher of the World.
And he won the debate by saying at last,
Before you reform the world, Mr. Tutt,
Please answer the question of Pontius Pilate:
What is Truth?
