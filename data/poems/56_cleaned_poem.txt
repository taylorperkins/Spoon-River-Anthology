OFTEN Aner Clute at the gate
Refused me the parting kiss,
Saying we should be engaged before that;
And just with a distant clasp of the hand
She bade me good-night, as I brought her home
From the skating rink or the revival.
No sooner did my departing footsteps die away
Than Lucius Atherton,
(So I learned when Aner went to Peoria)
Stole in at her window, or took her riding
Behind his spanking team of bays
Into the country.
The shock of it made me settle down,
And I put all the money I got from my fathers estate
Into the canning factory, to get the job
Of head accountant, and lost it all.
And then I knew I was one of Lifes fools,
Whom only death would treat as the equal
Of other men, making me feel like a man.
