I RAN away from home with the circus, 
Having fallen in love with Mademoiselle Estralada, 
The lion tamer. 
One time, having starved the lions 
For more than a day,         5
I entered the cage and began to beat Brutus 
And Leo and Gypsy. 
Whereupon Brutus sprang upon me, 
And killed me. 
On entering these regions  10
I met a shadow who cursed me, 
And said it served me right.... 
It was Robespierre!
