IF the excursion train to Peoria 
Had just been wrecked, I might have escaped with my life 
Certainly I should have escaped this place. 
But as it was burned as well, they mistook me 
For John Allen who was sent to the Hebrew Cemetery         5
At Chicago, 
And John for me, so I lie here. 
It was bad enough to run a clothing store in this town, 
But to be buried hereach!
