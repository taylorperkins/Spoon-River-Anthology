FROM Bindles opera house in the village 
To Broadway is a great step. 
But I tried to take it, my ambition fired 
When sixteen years of age, 
Seeing East Lynne played here in the village         5
By Ralph Barrett, the coming 
Romantic actor, who enthralled my soul. 
True, I trailed back home, a broken failure, 
When Ralph disappeared in New York, 
Leaving me alone in the city  10
But life broke him also. 
In all this place of silence 
There are no kindred spirits. 
How I wish Duse could stand amid the pathos 
Of these quiet fields  15
And read these words.
