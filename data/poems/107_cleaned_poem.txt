WHILE I was handling Dom Pedro
I got at the thing that divides the race between men who are
For singing Turkey in the straw or There is a fountain filled with blood
(Like Rile Potter used to sing it over at Concord);
For cards, or for Rev. Peets lecture on the holy land;
For skipping the light fantastic, or passing the plate;
For Pinafore, or a Sunday school cantata;
For men, or for money;
For the people or against them.
This was it:
Rev. Peet and the Social Purity Club,
Headed by Ben Pantiers wife,
Went to the Village trustees,
And asked them to make me take Dom Pedro
From the barn of Wash McNeely, there at the edge of town,
To a barn outside of the corporation,
On the ground that it corrupted public morals.
Well, Ben Pantier and Fiddler Jones saved the day
They thought it a slam on colts.
