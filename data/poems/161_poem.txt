HOW many times, during the twenty years 
I was your leader, friends of Spoon River, 
Did you neglect the convention and caucus, 
And leave the burden on my hands 
Of guarding and saving the peoples cause?         5
Sometimes because you were ill; 
Or your grandmother was ill; 
Or you drank too much and fell asleep; 
Or else you said: He is our leader, 
All will be well; he fights for us;  10
We have nothing to do but follow. 
But oh, how you cursed me when I fell, 
And cursed me, saying I had betrayed you, 
In leaving the caucus room for a moment, 
When the peoples enemies, there assembled,  15
Waited and watched for a chance to destroy 
The Sacred Rights of the People. 
You common rabble! I left the caucus 
To go to the urinal!
