DID you ever hear of Editor Whedon 
Giving to the public treasury any of the money he received 
For supporting candidates for office? 
Or for writing up the canning factory 
To get people to invest?         5
Or for suppressing the facts about the bank, 
When it was rotten and ready to break? 
Did you ever hear of the Circuit Judge 
Helping anyone except the Q railroad, 
Or the bankers? Or did Rev. Peet or Rev. Sibley  10
Give any part of their salary, earned by keeping still, 
Or speaking out as the leaders wished them to do, 
To the building of the water works? 
But IDaisy Fraser who always passed 
Along the streets through rows of nods and smiles,  15
And coughs and words such as there she goes, 
Never was taken before Justice Arnett 
Without contributing ten dollars and costs 
To the school fund of Spoon River!
