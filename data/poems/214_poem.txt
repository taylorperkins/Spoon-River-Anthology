I WAS the laughing-stock of the village, 
Chiefly of the people of good sense, as they call themselves 
Also of the learned, like Rev. Peet, who read Greek 
The same as English. 
For instead of talking free trade,         5
Or preaching some form of baptism; 
Instead of believing in the efficacy 
Of walking cracks, picking up pins the right way, 
Seeing the new moon over the right shoulder, 
Or curing rheumatism with blue glass,  10
I asserted the sovereignty of my own soul. 
Before Mary Baker G. Eddy even got started 
With what she called science 
I had mastered the Bhagavad Gita, 
And cured my soul, before Mary  15
Began to cure bodies with souls 
Peace to all worlds!
