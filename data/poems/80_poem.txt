I COULD not run or play 
In boyhood. 
In manhood I could only sip the cup, 
Not drink 
For scarlet-fever left my heart diseased.         5
Yet I lie here 
Soothed by a secret none but Mary knows: 
There is a garden of acacia, 
Catalpa trees, and arbors sweet with vines 
There on that afternoon in June  10
By Marys side 
Kissing her with my soul upon my lips 
It suddenly took flight.
