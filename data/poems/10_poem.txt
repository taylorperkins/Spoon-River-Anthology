IN life I was the town drunkard; 
When I died the priest denied me burial 
In holy ground. 
The which redounded to my good fortune. 
For the Protestants bought this lot,         5
And buried my body here, 
Close to the grave of the banker Nicholas, 
And of his wife Priscilla. 
Take note, ye prudent and pious souls, 
Of the cross-currents in life  10
Which bring honor to the dead, who lived in shame.
