AS a boy, Theodore, you sat for long hours 
On the shore of the turbid Spoon 
With deep-set eye staring at the door of the crawfishs burrow, 
Waiting for him to appear, pushing ahead, 
First his waving antennæ, like straws of hay,         5
And soon his body, colored like soap-stone, 
Gemmed with eyes of jet. 
And you wondered in a trance of thought 
What he knew, what he desired, and why he lived at all. 
But later your vision watched for men and women  10
Hiding in burrows of fate amid great cities, 
Looking for the souls of them to come out, 
So that you could see 
How they lived, and for what, 
And why they kept crawling so busily  15
Along the sandy way where water fails 
As the summer wanes.
