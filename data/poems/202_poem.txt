YOUR red blossoms amid green leaves 
Are drooping, beautiful geranium! 
But you do not ask for water. 
You cannot speak! You do not need to speak 
Everyone knows that you are dying of thirst,         5
Yet they do not bring water! 
They pass on, saying: 
The geranium wants water. 
And I, who had happiness to share 
And longed to share your happiness;  10
I who loved you, Spoon River, 
And craved your love, 
Withered before your eyes, Spoon River 
Thirsting, thirsting, 
Voiceless from chasteness of soul to ask you for love,  15
You who knew and saw me perish before you, 
Like this geranium which someone has planted over me, 
And left to die.
