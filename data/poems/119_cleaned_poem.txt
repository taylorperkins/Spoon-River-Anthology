BOTH for the country and for the man,
And for a country as well as a man,
Tis better to be feared than loved.
And if this country would rather part
With the friendship of every nation
Than surrender its wealth,
I say of a man tis worse to lose
Money than friends.
And I rend the curtain that hides the soul
Of an ancient aspiration:
When the people clamor for freedom
They really seek for power oer the strong.
I, Anthony Findlay, rising to greatness
From a humble water carrier,
Until I could say to thousands Come,
And say to thousands Go,
Affirm that a nation can never be good,
Or achieve the good,
Where the strong and the wise have not the rod
To use on the dull and weak.
