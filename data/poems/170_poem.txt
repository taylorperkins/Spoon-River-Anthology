IS it true, Spoon River, 
That in the hall-way of the New Court House 
There is a tablet of bronze 
Containing the embossed faces 
Of Editor Whedon and Thomas Rhodes?         5
And is it true that my successful labors 
In the County Board, without which 
Not one stone would have been placed on another, 
And the contributions out of my own pocket 
To build the temple, are but memories among the people,  10
Gradually fading away, and soon to descend 
With them to this oblivion where I lie? 
In truth, I can so believe. 
For it is a law of the Kingdom of Heaven 
That whoso enters the vineyard at the eleventh hour  15
Shall receive a full days pay. 
And it is a law of the Kingdom of this World 
That those who first oppose a good work 
Seize it and make it their own, 
When the corner-stone is laid,  20
And memorial tablets are erected.
