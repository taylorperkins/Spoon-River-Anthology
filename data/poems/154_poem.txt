Horses and men are just alike. 
There was my stallion, Billy Lee, 
Black as a cat and trim as a deer, 
With an eye of fire, keen to start, 
And he could hit the fastest speed         5
Of any racer around Spoon River. 
But just as youd think he couldnt lose, 
With his lead of fifty yards or more, 
Hed rear himself and throw the rider, 
And fall back over, tangled up,  10
Completely gone to pieces. 
You see he was a perfect fraud: 
He couldnt win, he couldnt work, 
He was too light to haul or plow with, 
And no one wanted colts from him.  15
And when I tried to drive himwell, 
He ran away and killed me.
