Observe the clasped hands!
Are they hands of farewell or greeting,
Hands that I helped or hands that helped me?
Would it not be well to carve a hand
With an inverted thumb, like Elagabalus?
And yonder is a broken chain,
The weakest-link idea perhaps
But what was it?
And lambs, some lying down,
Others standing, as if listening to the shepherd
Others bearing a cross, one foot lifted up
Why not chisel a few shambles?
And fallen columns! Carve the pedestal, please,
Or the foundations; let us see the cause of the fall.
And compasses and mathematical instruments,
In irony of the under tenants ignorance
Of determinants and the calculus of variations.
And anchors, for those who never sailed.
And gates ajaryes, so they were;
You left them open and stray goats entered your garden.
And an eye watching like one of the Arimaspi
So did youwith one eye.
And angels blowing trumpetsyou are heralded
It is your horn and your angel and your familys estimate.
It is all very well, but for myself I know
I stirred certain vibrations in Spoon River
Which are my true epitaph, more lasting than stone.
