IF you in the village think that my work was a good one,
Who closed the saloons and stopped all playing at cards,
And haled old Daisy Fraser before Justice Arnett,
In many a crusade to purge the people of sin;
Why do you let the millinerÂ’s daughter Dora,
And the worthless son of Benjamin Pantier
Nightly make my grave their unholy pillow?
