WE quarreled that morning, 
For he was sixty-five, and I was thirty, 
And I was nervous and heavy with the child 
Whose birth I dreaded. 
I thought over the last letter written me         5
By that estranged young soul 
Whose betrayal of me I had concealed 
By marrying the old man. 
Then I took morphine and sat down to read. 
Across the blackness that came over my eyes  10
I see the flickering light of these words even now: 
And Jesus said unto him, Verily 
I say unto thee, To-day thou shalt 
Be with me in paradise.
