THERE is something about Death 
Like love itself! 
If with some one with whom you have known passion, 
And the glow of youthful love, 
You also, after years of life         5
Together, feel the sinking of the fire, 
And thus fade away together, 
Gradually, faintly, delicately, 
As it were in each others arms, 
Passing from the familiar room  10
That is a power of unison between souls 
Like love itself!
