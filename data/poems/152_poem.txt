Observe the clasped hands! 
Are they hands of farewell or greeting, 
Hands that I helped or hands that helped me? 
Would it not be well to carve a hand 
With an inverted thumb, like Elagabalus?         5
And yonder is a broken chain, 
The weakest-link idea perhaps 
But what was it? 
And lambs, some lying down, 
Others standing, as if listening to the shepherd  10
Others bearing a cross, one foot lifted up 
Why not chisel a few shambles? 
And fallen columns! Carve the pedestal, please, 
Or the foundations; let us see the cause of the fall. 
And compasses and mathematical instruments,  15
In irony of the under tenants ignorance 
Of determinants and the calculus of variations. 
And anchors, for those who never sailed. 
And gates ajaryes, so they were; 
You left them open and stray goats entered your garden.  20
And an eye watching like one of the Arimaspi 
So did youwith one eye. 
And angels blowing trumpetsyou are heralded 
It is your horn and your angel and your familys estimate. 
It is all very well, but for myself I know  25
I stirred certain vibrations in Spoon River 
Which are my true epitaph, more lasting than stone.
