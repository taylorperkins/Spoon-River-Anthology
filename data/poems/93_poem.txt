MY valiant fight! For I call it valiant, 
With my fathers beliefs from old Virginia: 
Hating slavery, but no less war. 
I, full of spirit, audacity, courage 
Thrown into life here in Spoon River,         5
With its dominant forces drawn from New England, 
Republicans, Calvinists, merchants, bankers, 
Hating me, yet fearing my arm. 
With wife and children heavy to carry 
Yet fruits of my very zest of life.  10
Stealing odd pleasures that cost me prestige, 
And reaping evils I had not sown; 
Foe of the church with its charnel dankness, 
Friend of the human touch of the tavern; 
Tangled with fates all alien to me,  15
Deserted by hands I called my own. 
Then just as I felt my giant strength 
Short of breath, behold my children 
Had wound their lives in stranger gardens 
And I stood alone, as I started alone!  20
My valiant life! I died on my feet, 
Facing the silencefacing the prospect 
That no one would know of the fight I made.
