HERE I lie close to the grave 
Of Old Bill Piersol, 
Who grew rich trading with the Indians, and who 
Afterwards took the bankrupt law 
And emerged from it richer than ever.         5
Myself grown tired of toil and poverty 
And beholding how Old Bill and others grew in wealth, 
Robbed a traveler one night near Proctors Grove, 
Killing him unwittingly while doing so, 
For the which I was tried and hanged.  10
That was my way of going into bankruptcy. 
Now we who took the bankrupt law in our respective ways 
Sleep peacefully side by side.
