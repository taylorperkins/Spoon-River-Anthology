I STAGGERED on through darkness,
There was a hazy sky, a few stars
Which I followed as best I could.
It was nine oclock, I was trying to get home.
But somehow I was lost,
Though really keeping the road.
Then I reeled through a gate and into a yard,
And called at the top of my voice:
Oh, Fiddler! Oh, Mr. Jones!
(I thought it was his house and he would show me the way home.)
But who should step out but A. D. Blood,
In his night shirt, waving a stick of wood,
And roaring about the cursed saloons,
And the criminals they made?
You drunken Oscar Hummel, he said,
As I stood there weaving to and fro,
Taking the blows from the stick in his hand
Till I dropped down dead at his feet.
