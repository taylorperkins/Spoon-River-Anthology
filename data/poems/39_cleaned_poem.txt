I WAS sixteen, and I had the most terrible dreams,
And specks before my eyes, and nervous weakness.
And I couldnt remember the books I read,
Like Frank Drummer who memorized page after page.
And my back was weak, and I worried and worried,
And I was embarrassed and stammered my lessons,
And when I stood up to recite Id forget
Everything that I had studied.
Well, I saw Dr. Weeses advertisement,
And there I read everything in print,
Just as if he had known me;
And about the dreams which I couldnt help.
So I knew I was marked for an early grave.
And I worried until I had a cough,
And then the dreams stopped.
And then I slept the sleep without dreams
Here on the hill by the river.
